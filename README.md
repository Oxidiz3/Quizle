# Overview
This is an educational quiz app for math, science, reading, and writing. It has preset quiz cards 
but allows the user to make more. It Stores user made quiz cards on the cloud using Google Firebase. 
It targets elementary students (3rd grade) to help them review vocabulary in reading and science, 
practice spelling, and learn math with quiz cards. It also has a dark and light mode. 

*Function:*  
The app will allow the user to select between math, reading, writing, and science, and then a test
view or study view, the study view just pulls in the flash cards from the correct category and allows
the user to flip between them. The test view allows them to type in an answer and will check it against 
the database answer. The plus button on the bottom allows them to add flash cards to each category.
